## About
This is an unofficial ios app for MyAnimeList that integrates their [API](https://myanimelist.net/apiconfig/references/api/v2), allowing users to discover the top ranked, most popular, upcoming anime/manga, search for new titles, add new titles to their lists, and update their watch/read status and episode/chapter counts.

The app is still very much a work in progress, so many features may be unimplemented.
